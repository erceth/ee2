<p>JSFlags is a robot AI tank game. The tanks' movements, game engine, collision detection, controls and AI logic are all written in Node.js and Javascript. The view portion uses HTML canvas manipulated using Javascript.</p>
	            <p>The tanks take commands from a Node server via Socket.io.  A programmer takes the dummy AI code and improves it to create their own awesome AI and then battle against other programmer's AI.</p>
	            <p>When I worked at Unicity the IT department held a JSFlags tournament to see who built the best AI script.</p>
	            <p>I created a video where I explain how I upgraded the dummy AI to be able to navigate around obstacles and avoid other tanks.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omqTgNCXfbQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omqTgNCXfbQ</a></p>
