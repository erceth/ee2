Filer allows an administrator to share files with registered users.  This solve a problem my wife experienced as she taught voice lessons where students kept forgetting their USB flash drives.

Filer is a content management system that allows an administrator to upload files for users to download.  Users are required to log in to have access to the files. The system can handle any kind of file but it was designed for audio files.  The admin can also create inspirational quotes of the day that will appear in the footer.  The admin can create user wide reminders that will appear when a user logs in.

My wife runs a business were she teaches singing lessons.  She records the lessons on a student provided USB flash drive to aid her students while they practice between lessons.  Students often forgot to bring their flash drives.  This site allows her to upload student's lessons for them to download and utilize at home.
