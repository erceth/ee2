<p>Knockout Chess is a chess game built using knockoutJS.  The primary goal of this project was to teach myself KnockoutJs.  I thought it would be fun to try and build chess.</p>
<p>The squares are two-way bound to the controller.  Knockout automatically updates the state of the squares when the internal state of the game changes.</p>

<p>Pawns are the only pieces you can move and capture with.  The purpose of this project was to learn Knockout.  There is no Check, Castling, en passant capture, etc.</p>
