<p>This is a simple reddit like app built using Angular 2 and Typescript.  In my adventure learning Angular 2 I have been going through the <a href="https://www.ng-book.com/2/" target="_blank">ng-book2</a> book.  This project come from a tutorial from that book.</p>
<p>The source code of this project is written in Typescript and is transpiled into ES5 Javascript.  This process allows a programmer to take advantage of ES6 syntax and allow the transpiled code to run on many browsers.</p>
<p>The app shows articles with a title and a link.  The user can add additional articles to the list using the form at the top of the screen.  The user can upvote and downvote the articles in the list.</p>
