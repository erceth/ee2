This is a space shooter game I created using Unity and following their online <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.  The player controls a ship and shoots tumbling astroids for points.  
<br><br>The arrow keys are the movement controls and the spacebar is the fire button.
<br><br>
The scripts in this game utilize the C# language.

You may have to run this game in a web browser other than Chrome.
