<p>The Provo Freedom Festival is a series of events spanning several months celebrating Independence day.  This website is a detailed listing of those events.  I worked on this site while I worked for the digital agency called Rain.  The team I collaborated with consisted of producers and designs of which I was the only developer.</p>
<p>The festival is put on by the city of Provo, Utah.  Events include hot air balloon rides, patriotic celebrations, baby contests and parades.  The grand finale event is the Stadium of Fire which features popular musical artists and spectacular firework show.</p>
